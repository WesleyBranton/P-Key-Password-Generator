# P-Key Password Generator [<img align="right" src=".github/fxaddon.png">](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/password-generator/)
In the online world, there are many no-good villains looking to steal your online accounts and your identity. Whether it's your online banking, social media or email, **don't risk getting hacked!**

Many users on the internet do not use passwords that comply with the security standards, making them an easy target for hackers who are looking to take over their online accounts. The P-Key Password Generator add-on for Firefox can make it harder for a hacker to guess your password by providing you with a randomly generated password using the parameters which the user inputs.

The easy to use and polished user interface on this wizard make it easy for users to generate secure passwords in just a few clicks. Users can add four character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols, and can make a password up to 40 characters in length.

Making passwords was never so easy!
